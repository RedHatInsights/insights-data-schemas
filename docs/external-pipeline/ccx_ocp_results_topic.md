# Messages consumed from `ccx.ocp.results`

## Schema version

2 (unofficial)

## Description

Insights Results Aggregator is a service that provides Insight OCP data that
are being consumed by OpenShift Cluster Manager, OCP WebConsole and by other
services. That data contain information about clusters status (especially
health, security, performance) based on results generated by Insights rules
engine. Insights OCP data are consumed from selected broker and selected topic
named `ccx.ocp.results`, stored in a storage (that basically works as a cache)
and exposed via REST API endpoints. This document describes format of messages
consumed from `ccx.ocp.results` Kafka topic.

## Additional information

Messages are not transformed by any ETL tool in the Kafka topic, so the messages have the same format as described in the following section:
1. [Data produced by OCP rules engine](ccx_data_pipeline.md)

Please use the document mentioned above for further information.

## Possible enhancements

Version (positive integer) should be included in the message so the schema
change will be possible w/o breaking other services and tools.
