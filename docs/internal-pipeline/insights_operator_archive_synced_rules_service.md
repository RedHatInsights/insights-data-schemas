# Messages consumed by Rules service from `ccx-XXX-insights-operator-archive-synced` topic

Rules Service runs rules for all archives synced in DataHub (Ceph) bucket. It
reads messages from `ccx-XXX-insights-operator-archive-synced` Kafka topic to
know about incoming archives in Ceph and it will download the archive from
DataHub (Ceph) bucket.

The result of the applied rules is sent to
`ccx-XXX-insights-operator-archive-rules-results` Kafka topic.

This service is the same as Features Service but it uses a different
configuration.

## Schema version

1 (unofficial)

## Description

Messages consumed from `ccx-XXX-insights-operator-archive-synced` topic (where
`XXX` needs to be replaced by environment, for example `prod`) are created by
Archive Sync Service for each object stored into Ceph. These messages have very
simple format consisting of just three attributes:

* path
* original_path
* metadata


## Basic format

Messages are stored in JSON format and have to contain three attributes:

* `path` (string with path)
* `original_path` (string with path)
* `metadata` (dictionary)


### `path` attribute

This attribute contains path to object stored in Ceph. It must be real path
with chunks splitted by slash character.

An example of path structure:

```
archives/compressed/$ORG_ID/$CLUSTER_ID/$YEAR$MONTH/$DAY/$TIME.tar.gz
```


### `original_path` attribute

This attribute contains path to object stored in AWS S3. It must be real path
with chunks splitted by slash character.

An example of path:

```
1234567/abcd1234-1234-abcd-5678-1234abcd1234/20200609125740-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

### `metadata` attribute

This attribute contains two required sub-nodes:

* `cluster_id` (string) cluster ID represented as UUID
* `external_organization` (string) organization ID represented as a string (not integer)

---
**NOTE**

`cluster_id` uses its canonical textual representation: the 16 octets of a
UUID are represented as 32 hexadecimal (base-16) digits, displayed in five
groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36
characters (32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens).  For more information
please look at
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

An example of UUID:

```
3ba9b042-b8b8-4714-98e9-17915c2eeb95
```

## Possible enhancements

It would be possible to add a schema version into generated messages in JSON
format.
